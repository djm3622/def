# Diffusion-augmented Ensemble Forecasting

# TODO
1. (Data + Dataset) to get trajectories.
2. Seed + space these trajectories (in Tune).
3. Setup tuning function to test (solvers + guidance) -> determine where the strength and weakness of this method lies.
4. Setup SV-based perturbations.
5. Compare the two.
