# Diffusion-augmented Ensemble Forecasting

# TODO
1. (data.py + dataset.py) to get trajectories.
2. Seed + space these trajectories (in tune.py).
3. Test/setup the metrics on some trajectories (in metrics.py).
3. Setup tuning function to test (solvers + guidance) -> determine where the strength and weakness of this method lies.
4. Setup SV/ETKF-based perturbations (in traditional.py).
5. Compare the two (in comparisons.py).
